        <h1 class="about-tagline pb-5"> a local skateshop vibe for a global skateboard tribe</h1>

        <p class="pb-2"> Liquid Boards was setup by three independent skate shop owners from Dublin, New York and New
            Zealand. </p>

        <p class="pb-2"> Demand for Skateboards, Longboards and Surf-Skates has boomed over the last few years but a
            lack of global stock combined with supplychain issues has limited their availability.</p>

        <p class="pb-2"> The three skateshops have pooled their contacts & resources across three continents and
            combined their online presence allowing them to source and deliver quality boards & equipment for the
            growing community.</p>

        <p class="pb-3"> Whether you're looking for American, European, Asian brands or skate spots & events in New
            York, New Zealand or Ireland check out Liquid Boards. </p>

        <h3 class=" about-tagline pb-5"> . . get on board! </h3>
