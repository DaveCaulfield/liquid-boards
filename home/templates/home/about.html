    <p class="pb-2"> Liquid Boards was setup by three independent skate shop owners from Dublin, New York and New Zealand. </p>

    <p class="pb-2"> Demand for skateboards has boomed over the last few years but a lack of global stock and supplychains has limited their availability.</p>

    <p class="pb-2"> The three skateshops have pooled their contacts across three continents and have combined their online presence allowing them to deliver to a larger community.</p>
