    <strong> <p class="pb-5" > Local skateshop vibe for a global skateboard tribe </p></strong>
    
   
    <p class="pb-2"> Liquid Boards was setup by three independent skate shop owners from Dublin, New York and New Zealand. </p>

    <p class="pb-2"> Demand for Skateboards, Longboards and Surf-Skates has boomed over the last few years but a lack of global stock combined with supply chain issues has limited their availability.</p>

    <p class="pb-2"> The three skateshops have pooled their contacts & resources across three continents and combined their online presence allowing them to source and deliver quality boards & equipment for the growing community.</p>

    <p class="pb-2"> Whether you're looking for American or European brands or skate spots & events in New Zealand get in touch.  </p>
