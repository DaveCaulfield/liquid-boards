## Design

### User Experience (UX)
- The user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) was considered from the start of the design process. 
- The site aims to give the user an enjoyable experience whilst easily and intuitively navigating and interacting with the site on mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop devices.

### Colour scheme

- Adobe colour was used to extract the warm sunset colour #F2913D from the landing page image and was chosen as the color for the site logo, call to action button on the homepage and was interspersed throughout the site.
- A black background for the navbar frames each page of the site and gives a premium feel and helps to contrast the warm sunset coloring in the site.
- Adobe colour was also used to extract #F2F2F2 from the landing page image and is used as a light background color for the body of pages throughout the site.
